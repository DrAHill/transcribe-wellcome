# Library Accessions

Between 1899 and 2000, all library accessioning was recorded in handwritten, hard bound registers \(WA/HMM/LI/Acc/1-13\). As well as printed and published materials \(including incunabula and rare books\), the handwritten library accession registers included entries for manuscripts acquired prior to the year 2000. 

Formal accessioning of library materials began in January 1899, although sequential numbering was not introduced until 1910. 

Between 1981 and 2000, prints, paintings and drawings and some photographs were also accessioned into the library registers.

A separate accession register for archives and personal papers was begun in 1979. These accession entries were later input into Wellcome's collections management system for archives and do not form part of the dataset for Transcribe Wellcome.

#### Pre-1910 

The first library register starts on 10 January 1899, but notes of a few earlier acquisitions from December 1897 are inserted at the front. Although the entries in the register are not numbered, numbers were allocated and written on the top right hand corner of the flyleaf of each volume. Some of these numbers have been retrospectively written into the register by library staff at a later date.

Provenance information was usually also written in the books themselves at this date, in abbreviated form \(vendor/donor and date\), in the lower inner corner of the flyleaf or pastedown. There is a key to abbreviations used in provenance notes at the front of the first library register.

| Archive reference | Dates |
| :--- | :--- |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/1 | December 1897 to January 1902 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/2 | October 1902 to April 1910 |

#### 1910 to 1953

5 figure accession numbers \(e.g. 43129\) were allocated in sequence, although often more than one accession register was in use at a time:

| Archive reference  | Dates | Accession Numbers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/3 | April 1910 to April 1916 | 23723 to 39117 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/4 | April 1916 to May 1930 | 39118 to 52800 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/5 | May 1929 to August 1934 | 52801 to 62800 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/6 | May 1930 to June 1947 | 62801 to 72800 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/7 | February 1931 to December 1935 | 72801 to 82800 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/8 | January 1936 to March 1945 | 82801 to 92800 |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/9 | November 1942 to December 1953 | 92801 to 96489 |

From about 1913 to about 1946 accession numbers were written on the top right hand corner of the title page. Numbers previously written on the flyleaf were sometimes transferred to this position. Provenance notes were still sometimes written into the books well into the 1920s.

From around 1947 onwards, numbers were written on the verso of the title page. Sometimes numbers originally written on the recto were erased and transferred to the verso, particularly if a title page had to be photographed.

#### 1954 to 2000

In January 1954 a new 6 figure numeration was introduced, starting at 300001:

| Archive reference | Dates | Accession Numbers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/9 | January 1954 to July 1960 | 300001 to 306350 \(following on directly from the 5 figure numbers in the same volume\) |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/10 |  |  |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/11 |  |  |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/12 |  |  |
| WA/HMM/LI/Acc/13 |  |  |
