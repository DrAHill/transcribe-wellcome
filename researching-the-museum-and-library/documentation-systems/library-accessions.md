# Library Accessions

Between 1899 and 2000, all library accessioning was recorded in handwritten, hard bound registers \(WA/HMM/LI/Acc/1-13\). As well as printed and published materials \(including incunabula and rare books\), the handwritten library accession registers included entries for manuscripts acquired prior to the year 2000. 

Formal accessioning of library materials began in 1899, although sequential numbering was not introduced until 1910. 

Between 1981 and 2000, prints, paintings and drawings and some photographs were also accessioned into the library registers.

A separate accession register for archives and personal papers was begun in 1979. These accession entries were later input into Wellcome's collections management system for archives and do not form part of the dataset for Transcribe Wellcome.
