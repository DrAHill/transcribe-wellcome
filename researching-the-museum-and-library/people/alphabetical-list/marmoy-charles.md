Charles Marmoy

library assistant, in post from late 1930.

From oral history of Charles Marmoy, describing working in the Library at [Willesden) around 1930 ([Symons 1987 unpublished), 40):

"When interviewed I was told of plans to open a new museum and library in town; now we learned that owing to the Great Depression these plans were to be shelved, a great disappointment to all. We were faced with life in a backwater: there were no visitors, the only use of the library being an occasional request for a book to be sent up to [Wigmore Street](Wigmore Street, 54a). It was perhaps as a result of an urgent request that I went myself to the Museum and remember catching a glimpse of Henry Wellcome himself. Otherwise my work consisted of unpacking the many bundles and boxes received from the book auctions, entering up in a ledger those items worth keeping, and making simple cards by hand after checking with the catalogue. The more important items which were put into the historical collection were dealt with by the [Librarian](Moorat, Samuel Arthur Joseph) or the [senior assistant](Gardner, S. B.) and cards were typed by the secretary, [Miss Rose)."
