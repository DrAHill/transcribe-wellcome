Quotes from oral history, discussing work on the ethnographic collections:


<<<
We worked in an enormous gallery divided into compartments by screens and empty packing cases and spent most of our time identifying and cataloguing the thousands of objects bought in Sale Rooms. We were helped with the heavy work of lifting, opening cases etc. by two men, [Webb](Webb, Mr) & [Stow](Stow, Harry).  â€¦ I gather he and Webb between them did a lot of the bidding at sales when Sir Henry was building up the ethnographic collection.
