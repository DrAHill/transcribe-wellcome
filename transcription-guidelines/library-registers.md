## Transcription Setup

You can transcribe either directly from the Wellcome Library website or from a downloaded PDF of the digitised Library Accession Register.

Each transcription volunteer will be sent a transcription spreadsheet template and the relevant URL link  
e.g. [https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b28477613\#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.6045%2C-0.0693%2C2.2091%2C1.3858](https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b28477613#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.6045%2C-0.0693%2C2.2091%2C1.3858) \[Library Accession Register 4\]

The URL link in your email will take you to a specific Wellcome Library Accession Register \(WAHMM/LI/Acc\). If a message about ‘Archival material less than 100 years old’ pops up, click ‘Accept Terms and Open’ in order to load the Register pages into the Viewer:

![](../.gitbook/assets/3.png)

### Transcribing directly from the Wellcome Library website

The images on the Wellcome Library website are higher quality than those available when you download a PDF. This means that you can expand the image to full screen without loss of resolution using the controls at the bottom of the Viewer:

![](../.gitbook/assets/4.png) to expand to full screen view and ![](../.gitbook/assets/5.png) to exit back to the browser tab.

**Image Number**: If you decide to transcribe directly from the website, change the counter on the top \(grey\) toolbar of the Viewer window from ‘Page’ to ‘Image’ before you begin transcribing:

![](../.gitbook/assets/6.png)

### Transcribing from PDF

You may find it more convenient to transcribe from a PDF, which can be used offline or printed out.

To download a PDF of a Library Accession Register:

Click on ![](../.gitbook/assets/7%20%281%29.png) at the bottom left of the Viewer.

Check ‘Download as PDF \(pdf\)’ from the options menu

![](../.gitbook/assets/8%20%281%29.png)

Then click Download to create a PDF of the entire Register which you can save to your computer or other devices in the usual way.

**Important note**: if you choose to transcribe from PDF, _the image number must be transcribed as_ _**the PDF page number minus 1**_, because of the cover sheet added to the PDF. Also, due to the format of the Registers, information for each accession number will be spread across **two** pages. To ensure you are transcribing the correct row, it may be easier to fill in information from the left-hand page first for all the numbers before moving onto the right.

### Setting up your desktop

Open the transcription spreadsheet you have been sent via email and save to your documents \(either to your computer or OneDrive\). When you save the spreadsheet to your documents DO NOT change the file name. The file name contains the range of accession numbers covered by the individual spreadsheet which is important for filing later.

The column headings in the spreadsheet are explained in the section about the Transcription Spreadsheet below.

If you only have one monitor, it may help to arrange your browser / PDF window and the transcription spreadsheet one on top of the other, so that you can see both the Accession Register page and several rows in the transcription spreadsheet at the same time:

![](../.gitbook/assets/9.jpeg)

Once you have fully completed all the records in your spreadsheet, please upload your file to **Grp\_Wellcome Transcribers** on Microsoft Teams. At the top of the group’s page you will see a **‘Files’** tab. In there you will see a **‘Completed Spreadsheets’** folder, please upload your file there.

When you have uploaded your sheet, please leave a message in your respective channel so that the team are kept up to date.

### Using Grp\_Wellcome Transcribers

As part of the Wellcome Transcription Team you be invited to join the [Transcribers group](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a7358e913235e4459abd93d73245a1c72%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=4e7ed022-a0ad-4baa-89c6-490da57430b6&tenantId=3b7a675a-1fc8-4983-a100-cc52b7647737) \(joining code: jwovb6i\) on Microsoft Teams. The group is an important part of the transcription process and is the best way to keep up to date with updates, advice and events.

There are four channels within the group:

**General**: Where the organisation team/admin post important updates and event announcements. The ‘Files’ section on this channel is where members upload spreadsheets when they want feedback or once they have completed their transcriptions.

**Library Accession Registers**: A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Library Accession Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Library spreadsheets.

**Museum Index Cards**: A channel for members to ask for and read advice in transcribing the Museum Flimsy Slips. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Slips and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Museum spreadsheets.

**Visual Material Registers**: A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Visual Material Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Visual Material spreadsheets.

**Transcribers**: Here is where members can introduce themselves and ask for Library or Museum spreadsheets.

**FAQ**: A channel answering frequently asked questions on all aspects of the transcription work.

### Creative Commons Licence

While Wellcome waives copyright in transcriptions completed by staff, a Creative Commons zero \(CC0\) licence has been applied to allow for individuals outside of Wellcome to work on transcription. The full text of the licence can be found below.

_Transcriptions of items held within the Wellcome Collection will only be accepted by Wellcome if provided under a Creative Commons 0 \(“CC-0”\) licence. This CC-0 licence \(also known as a “public domain dedication”\) allows you to waive copyright and database interests in the submitted works and thereby to place them as completely as possible in the public domain. Others can freely build upon, enhance and reuse your contributions for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law. It also means that Wellcome can share your submitted transcription with Wikidata._

_Wellcome is committed to safeguarding your personal information in accordance with data protection law. Our privacy statement \(_[_https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-privacy-statement-20190805.pdf_](https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-privacy-statement-20190805.pdf)_\) explains how, and on what legal basis, we collect, store, and use any personal information which you share with us in connection with your sharing transcriptions with us._

If you have any questions regarding the CC0 licence, please get in touch via Teams.

## The Transcription Spreadsheet

The column headings in the transcription spreadsheet correspond – broadly – to the headings printed in the thirteen Library Accession Registers, plus some additional columns for recording details which may be useful for future data analysis and online search. It is indicated in the column heading instructions if, and where, headings differ between spreadsheet and Register e.g. Location Number \(Column G\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\].

The style of the Accession Registers changed over time, and according to the purpose for which they were used by Wellcome Historical Medical Library, and some headings were rarely used. Fields on the spreadsheet may be hidden for these headings.

**Important note**: Any duplicate library accession numbers should be added to the bottom of your spreadsheet with comments in the **Transcriber’s Notes \(Column W\)**. As duplicate accession numbers require extra checks before importing, please highlight these rows with a colour so that they can be identified easily.

### General transcription instructions

Generally, each accession \(unique number\) will be transcribed onto **one** row of the spreadsheet.

For the majority of columns you will be asked to transcribe the information exactly as it appears on the page. For a couple of columns you will be asked to transcribe the information into a standardised format. This is to assist with future research and will be made clear in the individual instructions.

For any text which has been scored through, do the same in the transcription. If you do use the strikethrough, or any other formatted text, you **must** use the appropriate tagging e.g. &lt;s&gt;\[transcribed text here\]&lt;/s&gt; or &lt;i&gt;\[_transcribed text here_\]&lt;/i&gt; for italics.

In some Registers, earlier information is visible in pencil underneath the final pen entry. If this is the case, add a **Transcriber’s Note** and include any of the information written in pencil where legible.

If you cannot decipher the handwriting use \[.\] to indicate an indecipherable letter e.g. mon\[.\]stro\[..\]ty. The number of dots = number of missing letters. If you use dots for text you are unsure of, please make a note in the **Transcriber's Notes** e.g. Unsure: word/letter in title. Use \[?\] if you have guessed at a letter or word e.g. Mhairi\[?\].

If there are square brackets, question marks or dots in the Register already, add a note to the **Transcriber’s Notes** i.e. The square brackets in the author column are in the original document.

All Latin characters with accents should be transcribed by inserting the correct symbol e.g. Â.

If you notice anything is written in non-Latin script make a note in the **Transcriber’s Notes** and, if you cannot discern or transliterate it, please put \[…\].

If the register uses ‘ditto’ or ‘//’ in the columns, replace ‘ditto’ with the information from the row above e.g. if one row has the title ‘The Mirror of Beauty’ and the row below has ‘// // // // \(The Dentist\)’, the title of the second book should be transcribed as ‘The Mirror of Beauty \(The Dentist\)’.

You are not expected/required to expand abbreviated words e.g. Imp\[erial\]. Simply transcribe the abbreviation as it appears on the page and, if you can identify the word, add a note to the **Transcriber’s Notes**. If you have larger problems reading the text on the slips, or are unsure of anything, please also note this in the **Transcriber’s Notes** column.

Apart from the **Date of Accession \(Column A\)** leave any blank spaces blank. Blank spaces and columns are common in the Registers and do not need noting.

If you encounter any problems identifying words, letters or symbols head to the Transcribers’ Group on Microsoft Teams. There may be others who have asked or answered the same questions. A quick google search may also help with titles and authors but the search results should never take priority over the text on the Register page.

### Column Headings

Date of Accession \(Column A\) \[Date of Receipt in Registers 12;13\]**:** The date of the accession is listed in the first column of the Library Accession Register. Always transcribe the date in full in the order of dd-month-full year e.g. 25 April 1916. Even if the date column is blank or if there are no ditto marks, assume that multiple items were added to the Register on the same day.

To aid filtering and analysis, if several consecutive dates are given, enter the **latest** day that these items were accessioned e.g. 6-9 January 1931 should be entered as 9 January 1931 with a **Transcriber’s Note** saying, ‘Accession date normalised to last day of entry’. If the date of accession is recorded as only a month or a year, provide the last possible date the accession may have occurred e.g. September 1928 should be entered as 30 September 1928 with the same **Transcriber’s Note**. For dates in February, you may find [this list of leap years 1800 - 2400](https://kalender-365.de/leap-years.php) useful.

AccNo \(Column B\)**:** The accession numbers have already been provided in a sequential order. Use these numbers to keep track of where you are on the page. IMPORTANT: Make sure you double-check the accession numbers as you go along as there may be a break or mistake in the sequential numbering in the Register. If you come across an accession number which is out of sequence, please add this to the bottom of your spreadsheet and add a note to the **Transcriber’s Notes**.

Register and Volume URL \(Columns C and D\)**:** These columns do not require transcription and may be hidden. _Please Note: Other columns in the spreadsheet may be hidden if they are not applicable to a specific register._

**Register \(Column C\): Wellcome reference for the Library Accession Register.**

**Volume URL \(Column D\): URL for the digitised version of the Library Accession Register on wellcomelibrary.org. This URL will be the same for all the accession numbers within a single register.**

LH Page Image no./RH Page Image no. \(Columns E and F\)**:** For each accession number, enter the image number given in the Wellcome Library website Viewer toolbar. If you are transcribing from a PDF, the image number is the page number minus 1. REMEMBER - the information for each row in the Accession Register is split across two pages.

Location Number \(Column G\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\]**:** Enter the location letter/number, if applicable, in this column. Most frequent abbreviations are M.C. \(Museum Case\) and P.C. \(Packing Case\).

Author \(Column H\) \[excluding Register 3\]**:** Transcribe the information in the ‘author’ column on the Register page. The author name should be standardised to read: Surname, Forenames \(Title, if applicable\) e.g. Braithwaite, William K. \(Capt.\). Do not transcribe brackets around the forenames e.g. Franklin \(Rosalind\) should be standardised to Franklin, Rosalind.

Title/Description \(Column I\)**:** Transcribe the information exactly as it is written on the page. Spelling, particularly for the titles of early modern books, can be very different to that of modern-day words e.g. you may see the word ‘chirurgerie’ instead of ‘surgery’. Transcribe titles exactly as they appear on the Register rather than correcting them to modern standards.

No of vols. \(V or P\) \(Column J\)**:** This column will contain a numerical value to show the number of volumes associated with the accession number/title of a printed item e.g. one entry ‘Voyages in the Southern Hemisphere’ is composed of 4 volumes. The column will contain the letter ‘P’ if the item is a pamphlet.

No. of vols \(Manuscripts\) \(Column K\)**:** Similar to above, this column will contain a numerical value to show the number of volumes associated with the accession number/title of a manuscript.

Size \(Column L\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\]**:** Transcribe the size as it appears on the page. The column may contain a measurement e.g. 20 x 15, a format e.g. post 4to, or a mixture of the two e.g. 8vo 23. Transcribe fractions \(e.g. in measurements\) using Insert – Symbol and selecting the correct proper fraction.

The following are keyboard shortcuts that can be used instead of the insert method:  

**Alt + 0188 = ¼ Alt + 0189 = ½ Alt + 0190 = ¾** 

All other fractions need to be written out as e.g. 5/8, remembering to put a space beforehand, i.e. 3 5/8" as the other Excel symbols do not import onto other platforms.

If you encounter difficulties in finding the correct symbol, record this in the **Transcriber’s Notes.** Please note: The format refers to the size of the book not the number of volumes e.g. 8vo = octavo format. For guidance on technical/archaic format terms see: [https://www.harringtonbooks.co.uk/booksizes.php](https://www.harringtonbooks.co.uk/booksizes.php).

Place of Publication \(Imprint\) \(Column M\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\]**:** Transcribe exactly as on the page. Many place names will be written in Latin e.g. Londini = London, so if you are having any difficulty deciphering the place name you can check for possible places on this website: [http://rbms.info/lpn/](http://rbms.info/lpn/). Do not standardise into English.

Date of Publication \(Imprint\) \(Column N\) \[excluding Register 3\]**:** This is the date, usually just a year, in which the book was printed/published. If the date is in Roman numerals transcribe it into Arabic numerals e.g. MDCCLXI = 1761. Online converter: [https://www.periodni.com/roman\_numerals\_converter.html](https://www.periodni.com/roman_numerals_converter.html)

Printer \(Column O\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\]**:** These may be individuals \(J. Antonius\), publishing companies \(Clarendon Press\) or institutions \(Government Pr\[ess\] Office\). Transcribe as on the page.

Price/Cost \(Column P\)**:** The three columns in the Registers represent pounds \(£\), shillings \(s\) and pence \(d\). If the price is not provided in pounds sterling, simply transcribe the currency as it is written e.g. 36l.

If the price refers to a group of books put in the price and put in brackets for how many items e.g. if the Register lists the price for three books as 20-6-3 transcribe as £20 6s 3d \[3 items\] for each item. If unsure of the number of items put \[? items\]. Provide the range of accession numbers affected in each row of the **Transcriber’s Notes** e.g. Price for 40100-40102 \[3 items\].

**Please note**: You only need to add the number of items in brackets when the price refers to multiple accessions e.g. if there is a single price written in the price column for accession number 40101 which also refers to accession numbers 40100 and 40102. This is because, in the future, information in each individual row will appear on its own in searches without the context of the information above and below it on the Register page.

For volumes, it is clear in each individual accession number/row how many volumes there were and what was paid for all of them so you do not need to record that information in brackets or in the notes.

Valuation \(Column Q\) \[excluding Registers 3;12;13\]**:** Transcribe as in the Price column.

Donor or Vendor \(Source\) \(Column R\)**:** Transcribe the acquisition details as they appear on the page. These may be a name of an individual \(De Bacq\) or an institution \(College of Physicians\). In many cases, the acquisition will be an auction purchase - e.g. Soth. 6 & 7/12/20 Lot 196 refers to lot 196 sold at Sotheby’s during the sale held on 6 and 7 December 1920.

Below are some common auction houses and abbreviations:

Bligh = Bligh & Co.

Ch.= Christies

Deb.= Debenham Stores

Fos.= Foster

Glen. = Glendining

H.= Hurcomb

Hodgson = Hodgsons

K.F.&R.= Knight, Frank & Rutley

Maggs. = Maggs Brothers

R.F.&H.= Robinson, Fisher & Harding

P.&S.= Puttick & Simpson

P.S.&N.= Phillips Son & Neale

Soth.= Sotheby’s

St.= Stevens

Wigginton = Wigginton

The auction house list is by no means exhaustive and is presented merely to help with identifying letters/names. As in other columns, transcribe the abbreviations as they appear and note possible expansions in the **Transcriber’s Notes**. Do not attempt to make the transcription ‘fit’ the abbreviation.

Lot Number \(Column S\) \[Register 3 only\]**:** Enter the lot number, if applicable, in this column.

Condition \(Column T\) \[Registers 12;13 only\]**:** Enter any physical condition notes, if applicable, in this column.

Remarks \(Column U\) \[excluding Register 3\]**:** Transcribe any remarks exactly as they appear on the page.

Transcribed by \(Column V\)**:** Your email address e.g. j.bloggs@wellcome.org.

Transcriber’s Notes \(Column W\)**:** A place for the transcriber to add any additional notes about the record e.g. if the record was written in multiple hands or if the record has corrections/later additions/prefixes. Also use this column to note any problems you have had with the transcription. Prefix this note with ‘Unsure’ followed by an explanation e.g. ‘Unsure: cannot read first name of author’.

**Important note:** If you have made a remark that relates to more than one accession, please make sure you add it into every relevant **Transcriber’s Notes** column. In the future, each row may be displayed individually without the context of the rows above and below it. For the same reason, do not use the phrases ‘see above’ or ‘see below’ in any column.

Creative Commons Licence \(Column X\): This column assigns the CC0 terms to each row of transcribed data and does not require transcription.

Happy Transcribing!
